# End-to-End-Learning-for-Self-Driving-Cars

This code helps in getting the steering angle of self driving car. The inspiraion is taken from [Udacity Self driving car](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3) module as well End to End Learning for [Self-Driving Cars](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/) module from NVIDIA.

The End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars research paper can be found at (https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316) This repository uses CNNs to predict steering angle of the car according to the different roads.
